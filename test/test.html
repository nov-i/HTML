      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

      <p>I am from Russia originally; I moved to Sault Ste. Marie, MI when I was 2 years old. I've always been interested in creating things since a young age. I had a vivid imagination and would come up with many ideas. As I got older, and became more involved with the internet, I developed an interest in coding. </p>
